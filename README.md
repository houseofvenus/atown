### Background

ATOWN is a framework for building semantic webs. It is designed to make exploring concepts in Hyperreality more accessible.

In ATOWN, any observable process, or entity, can be reduced to four essential component types. Using these types, an observer can deconstruct any process or entity using other processes and/or entities. Thus each one forms a node on a distributed network of processes/entities whose behaviors and functionality can be described using their respective connections to other nodes within this disrributed hierarchy. 

In the Public Augmented Reality Kinectome (pARk), our serialization of ATOWN for web content, resources are addressed by the semantic value of their content rather than the physical location address of said content on the network. The primary advantages of this system for web development are that any web page can be built from other web pages -- UI, functionality, and all -- and that content is not hosted on a single machine but available instantly to all members of the network.

### ATOWN Types

In ATOWN, there are four essential component types:
- ENVIRONMENT
- OBJECT-SUBJECT
- EFFECTOR
- SELECTOR

These component types are drawn from the framework's primary objective to effectively study concepts in Hyper Reality. If one conceives of every observable experience as a scene on a stage then the origin of the tags is intuitive. The ENVIRONMENT is defined by the phyiscal bounds of the scene and its setting (weather, etc.). The OBJECT-SUBJECTs are the physical objects within the scene, actors, props, moving elements of the scenery, etc. EFFECTORs and SELECTORs describe physical forces that describe the interactions between OBJECT-SUBJECTs and the ENVIRONMENT as well as interations between each other.

### Environments and Defining Hyper-Real Spaces

One of the core distinctions between the ATOWN conception of Hyper Reality and other frameworks for studying this concept is the assertion that:
- There is no reality besides hyper-reality

This departs from the common perception of "reality" as a range of potential experiences. The disadvantage of the spectra is that placing "virtual" experiences at one point and "real" and "augmented" experiences at other points along a line assumes by definition to know  with certainty the nature of said realities, i.e. one is less "real" than another. In ATOWN all potential formats of an experience exist simultaneously. What is observed is known as the PM, the polarizing matrix, and it is a measure of what a given observer is capable of perceiving at the moment. ATOWN avoids any assertions about the "truth" of a reality unlike in the traditional method of organizing reality along a spectrum. In ATOWN the only assertions we make about reality (defined as "that which is observed") are the following tautologies:

Given a "reality" is "an observable experience"
- what we can observe, we can observe
- what we cannot, we cannot
- thus there is no total reality besides hyper-reality, which is defined as the set of all realities we can observe
