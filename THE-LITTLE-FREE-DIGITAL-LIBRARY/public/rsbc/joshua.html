            The chronicle of the life of Joshua and the works he accomplished in the name of the God of Israel for His Chosen People is an epic all unto its own. The brevity of the chapter does little to dim the tremendous insight we gain into the lives of the ancient Israelites as we watch them grow from a meandering band of desert wandering tribes into the fear-mongering conquerors of a territory extending from the Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea.

            Ultimately this book serves as an introduction into the origins of Israel — part historical, part mythological. It also demonstrates the importance of obedience in institutions and societies that have been heavily influenced by Judeo-Christian mores.

        <p class="post-line-container">
            Joshua’s life and many of the themes explored in its account are centered around two fundamental principles: STRENGTH and COURAGE. 
        </p>
        <p class="post-line-container">
            God—and by extension Joshua, the priests, clan patriarchs and other leaders within the ancient Israeli communities —repeatedly commands the Israelites to be « very strong and courageous » (Joshua 1:7, Joshua 1:9). The ability to overcome obstacles depends solely on the Israelites’ willingness to be faithful. Faith is the source of courage. Obedience to the word of God is the source of strength. These two empower Israel to conquer her enemies. When she falters, remediation occurs by excising the unfaithful or disobedient among her ranks. The stoning of Achan, an Israelite who sinned against God by coveting and stealing silver, serves as an example of this justice (Joshua 7:20-25). The idea that failure is attributed to a lack of faith and not poor preparation, a lack of understanding, or inadequate skill is one that can be found today in present Christian doctrines (e.g. doomsday cults, election deniers).

            Purity is a strong prerequisite for the action of God and can only be achieved through obedience. Obedience is so vital to God that it can absolve the worst crimes (i.e. sins) and cleanses one of society’s most lowly regarded individuals — a foreign prostitute.

            Rehab the innkeeper-prostitute is spared from the ire of Israel in its the destruction of Jericho. Her housing situation reflects the lower class status she holds within Jericho’s society. She lives in the infamous walls [link to song about the Battle of Jericho], the literal first line of defense in the event of a siege. Her body and her home are expendable, available for the service of the city and its guests —be they friendly or not!— and yet it is she that the God of Israel chose to raise up—saved by a Scarlett marker [link to the Scarlett Letter]. Her virtue was not derived from her past but her commitment to serve (ie obey) and continue to obey the God of Israel. This is an important facet of Judeo-Christian ideology that has permeated into the wider world of western thought and western institutions. Virtue comes not necessarily from the moral quality of an act in and of itself but rather from the source/impetus for the action in question. Joshua commits several genocides in order to secure land for Israel. None are spared. Not women. Not children. Only those who aid the God of Israel and His Chosen People are redeemed and that — in His eyes — is just.

        <p class="post-line-container">
            Take note of the Bible’s depiction of this lady of the night; the symbols used in Rehab’s story are important as is her redemption.

            Anyone looking to understand the tenacity of modern proponents and followers of Judaism, Christianity, or Islam should read the Book of Joshua. Beyond  the Abrahamic religions, it tells a common, human story of how people without a home must first find one amongst themselves through community, a bond stronger than time forged by adversity (the walk through the wilderness), and then build upon that foundation. Neighbors be warned: such unity often comes at the expense of others… [link to conflict in Palestine]
