### Quick Guide
1. Background
2. Books + Films
3. Exchange

### Background

Knowledge should be freely accessible. There is a crisis of education in the United States primarily driven by wealth inequality that has been exacerbated by political tensions, poor administration, and unsatisfactory efforts. The youth must fix this or perish. 

"The Human Mind is Our Fundamental Resource"
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States of America

In the previous age, Millenials revolutionized the telemedia landscape by pioneering peer-to-peer principles in digital technology. Music, film, television, could all be broadcast to millions and now billions with ease.

Now, in our age Generation Z and Alpha has the opportunity to pioneer the application of these same principles to physical domains. Why not start with books and films?

### Books

Our primary objectives are to:
(a) digitize the contents of every Little Free Library in North America and assemble it into one corpus.
(b) facilitate book and film exchanges between neighbors

Private collections whose articles have been donated and cleared for non-commercial reuse will be included here. Updates regularly.

### Exchange

Owners of a Little Free Library can claim their library catalogue by providing verification of ownership at https://littlefreedigitallibrary.com .and make its contents available to share and borrow from the network.
