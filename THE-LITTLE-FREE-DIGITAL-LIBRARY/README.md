### Background

Knowledge should be freely accessible. There is a crisis of education in the United States primarily driven by wealth inequality that has been further exacerbated by political tensions, poor administration, and unsatisfactory objectives. We must fix this or perish. 

"The Human Mind is Our Fundamental Resource"
John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States of America

In the previous age, Millenials revolutionized the telemedia landscape by pioneering peer-to-peer principles in digital technology. Music, film, television, could all be broadcast to millions and now billions with ease thanks to their early efforts.

Now, in our age Generation Z and Alpha has the opportunity to pioneer the application of these same principles to physical domains. Why not start with books?

### Books
